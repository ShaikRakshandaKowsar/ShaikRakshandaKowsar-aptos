# DID Identity Wallet

## Project Description

The DID Identity Wallet is a decentralized identity management smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain. This project enables users to create and manage their digital identities through a secure, self-sovereign identity system. Users can store verifiable credentials issued by trusted entities, maintain complete control over their personal data, and share specific credentials when needed without compromising their privacy.

The smart contract provides a foundation for building decentralized applications that require identity verification, credential management, and trust establishment in a permissionless environment.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to empower individuals with complete ownership and control over their digital identities. In an increasingly connected world, we believe that:

- **Self-Sovereignty**: Users should own and control their identity data without relying on centralized authorities
- **Privacy-First**: Personal information should be shared selectively and with explicit consent
- **Interoperability**: Identity systems should work across different platforms and services
- **Trust & Verification**: Enable verifiable credentials that can be trusted without exposing sensitive personal information
- **Accessibility**: Provide simple, user-friendly tools for identity management that anyone can use

We aim to create a future where digital identity is portable, secure, and puts users first - eliminating the need for multiple accounts, reducing identity theft risks, and giving people true ownership of their digital presence.
